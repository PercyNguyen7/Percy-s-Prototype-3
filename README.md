# Iterative: Figment of Imagination

Question for playtesters:
1. Did you manage to escape the haunted park? If yes, how did you manage to find the way out and how long did it take approximately?
2. Were the hidden hints helpful/clear enough to guide you to escape the park?
3. What could be the plot/story behind this iterative? 
4. What are your thoughts regarding the aesthetic / ambience of the park? 
5. What do you think about the sound design? Would you include/remove any sound?
6. Most favorite and least favorite part of the interative!
7. Did you run into any issues (for ex low frame rate, bug/glitches, ...) while playing the game? Or just anything else you'd like to tell me?


# Prototype 3: The Void Calls, The End Awaits.

## Questions

Thank you for playtesting my prototype :)
 Sprinting by holding shift is strongly recommended.
 
 Playtest Questions:
 1. Before collecting the first memory, what genre did you think the game fit into?
 2.  In one sentence, could you tell me (to the best of your ability) what this prototype is about?
 3. There is a reccurence of the phrase "The View From Half Way Down", what do you think this refers to? (HAH. This was an english exam all along!)
 4. Did the gameplay feel smooth and satisfying? What are your thoughts on the alternation between first and third person view?
 5. If you were the designer, name two components that you would change/add to the prototype.
 6. Was there any particular problems/bugs you ran into (ie game not reloading when jumped, collision not working properly) that you would like to tell me?

 Feel free to ask me about the resources/tutorial I used to make this prototype!
 
 ## Design Hypothesis
 
  Please read only if you have playtested the prototype!  
 
  This prototype is merely a work of fiction inspired by the poem "The View from Half Way Down" from the Netflix series "Horsing Around". The recitation of the poem is in the following scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt21dU5Pu8g.
  
  Design hypothesis:
 -  Players will be able to collect all 7 memories successfully.
 -  Player know that the final action to finish the game is to jump down to its death.
 -  Players understand the main story: A depressed clown reflecting on its life halfway through its suicidal jump.
 -  Players will sprint most of the time as walking is quite slow and less satisfying.

 Purposes of the game:
 - Telling a dishearting narrative through sound design 
 
   Full poem: 
   The View From Halfway Down  
 The weak breeze whispers nothing  
 the water screams sublime.  
 His feet shift, teeter-totter  
 deep breaths, stand back, it’s time.  

 Toes untouch the overpass  
 soon he’s water-bound.  
 Eyes locked shut but peek to see  
 the view from halfway down.  

 A little wind, a summer sun  
 a river rich and regal.  
 A flood of fond endorphins  
 brings a calm that knows no equal.  

 You’re flying now, you see things  
 much more clear than from the ground.  
 It's all okay, or it would be  
 were you not now halfway down.  

 Thrash to break from gravity  
 what now could slow the drop?  
 All I’d give for toes to touch  
 the safety back at top.  

 But this is it, the deed is done  
 silence drowns the sound.  
 Before I leaped I should've seen  
 the view from halfway down.  

 I really should’ve thought about  
 the view from halfway down.  
 I wish I could've known about  
 the view from halfway down—

 ## Reflection to Playtest Feedback 
 Positive feedbacks:
- Good visuals 
- Good sound design
- All playtesters understood the narrative of the game
- The creepy and gloomy atmosphere was indeed achieved

Criticisms to be addressed:
- Collision with sphere do not work properly from times to times
- Walk speed too slow comparing to run speed
- Bridge at the end was too narrow
- Major lag spike in the beginning of the game
- Voice overlapping each others when one is not done playing

Suggestions:
- Adding particles 
- Adding new texture for the terrain
- Interactive NPCs
