# Prototype 3: The Void Calls, The End Awaits.

## Questions

Thank you for playtesting my prototype :)
 Sprinting by holding shift is strongly recommended.
 
 Playtest Questions:
 1. Before collecting the first memory, what genre did you think the game fit into?
 2.  In one sentence, could you tell me (to the best of your ability) what this prototype is about?
 3. There is a reccurence of the phrase "The View From Half Way Down", what do you think this refers to? (HAH. This was an english exam all along!)
 4. Did the gameplay feel smooth and satisfying? What are your thoughts on the alternation between first and third person view?
 5. If you were the designer, name two components that you would change/add to the prototype.
 6. Was there any particular problems/bugs you ran into (ie game not reloading when jumped, collision not working properly) that you would like to tell me?

 Feel free to ask me about the resources/tutorial I used to make this prototype!
 
 ## Hypothesis Design
 
  Please read only if you have playtested the prototype!
 
  This prototype is merely a work of fiction inspired by the poem "The View from Half Way Down" from the Netflix series "Horsing Around". The recitation of the poem is in the following scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt21dU5Pu8g.
  
   Full poem: 
   The View From Halfway Down
 The weak breeze whispers nothing
 the water screams sublime.
 His feet shift, teeter-totter
 deep breaths, stand back, it’s time.

 Toes untouch the overpass
 soon he’s water-bound.
 Eyes locked shut but peek to see
 the view from halfway down.

 A little wind, a summer sun
 a river rich and regal.
 A flood of fond endorphins
 brings a calm that knows no equal.

 You’re flying now, you see things
 much more clear than from the ground.
 It's all okay, or it would be
 were you not now halfway down.

 Thrash to break from gravity
 what now could slow the drop?
 All I’d give for toes to touch
 the safety back at top.

 But this is it, the deed is done
 silence drowns the sound.
 Before I leaped I should've seen
 the view from halfway down.

 I really should’ve thought about
 the view from halfway down.
 I wish I could've known about
 the view from halfway down—
